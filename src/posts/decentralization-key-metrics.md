If you have read through previous chapters of this blog, you will understand one of the core underlying philosophies behind cryptocurrency is decentralization. We are well aware that the blockchain mitigates the reliance on centralized financial systems, liberating individual and institutions and providing for financial autonomy. Decentralization refers to the transfer of control and decision-making from one centralized entity to dispersed networks.

Decentralized systems aim to lower the reliance that members have to place in one another, and to deprive any of the capacity to exercise authority in order to control or exclude participants. In a decentralized market, investors deal directly with each other rather than run on a centralized exchange. Decentralized financial systems utilize digital assets as a bridge between independent participants who may never know each others identity.


Decentralization is not a new concept. Computer science, makes the distinction between centralized and distributed architectures. In the former clients rely on a single governing authority to manage and run operations, which while more efficient presents a single point of failure, where in the later peer-to-peer communication facilitates robustness and fault-tolerance.

By decentralizing resource management and access in an application, and fairer service may be provided such that all users have equal access to scarce resources. Decentralization generally involves compromises, such as slower transfer rates and data needs to be propagated across disparate entities, but provides increased stability and censorship-resistance.

## Advantages of Decentralization

1. **It creates an environment that isn't based on trust of a single authority.**

<div style="padding: 0 0 15px 50px">
No one has to know or trust anybody else in particular on a decentralized blockchain. In the form of a distributed ledger, each member of the network owns a copy of the exact same data. If a member's ledger is tampered with or corrupted in any manner, the remaining members of the network will reject it.
</div>

2. **Increases the accuracy of data reconciliation**

<div style="padding: 0 0 15px 50px">
Companies frequently share information with their partners. This data is then converted and kept in each party's data silos, only to be resurfaced when it's time to transmit it downstream. Each time data is converted, the possibility of data loss or erroneous data entering the workstream increases. Decentralized data storage allows every entity gets access to a real-time, shared view of the data.
</div>

3. **Points of vulnerability are reduced**

<div style="padding: 0 0 15px 50px">
Decentralization can help to mitigate sources of vulnerability in systems when single actors are overly reliant. Systemic failures might result from these flaws, such as inability to provide promised services or inefficient service owing to resource exhaustion, frequent outages, bottlenecks, a lack of appropriate incentives for excellent service, or corruption.
</div>

4. **Distributes resources more efficiently.**

<div style="padding: 0 0 15px 50px">
Decentralization may also aid in resource distribution optimization, ensuring that promised services are delivered with greater performance and consistency, as well as a lower risk of catastrophic failure.
</div>

Each network design has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Unlike centralized systems, decentralized network, put reliability and security over performance. As a result, as a blockchain network grows in size, the network becomes more secure, but performance is impacted as each member node must check the data contributed to the ledger. Adding more participants to a decentralized network might make it safer, but it isn't always quicker. 

## The distribution of nodes of major cryptocurrencies

![node distribution](@/assets/posts/decentralization-key-metrics/node-distribution.jpg)

On a peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain nodes independently have copies of blockchain data. When a transaction occurs, the node creating the transaction broadcasts details to its peers who relays it to their peers and so on and so forth.

Blockchains are typically implemented via cross-platform, open-source software that allows developers to build a variety of applications. The P2P protocol lets nodes in the network interact with one another and share information about transactions and new blocks.

The correctness and dependability of compiling data in a distributed ledger is the responsibility of network nodes. A complete copy of the distributed ledger may be stored on each node or nodes may only store subsets (called shards). Any user with access to the data and the ability to observe the transactions contained within it.

Until recently, deploying a node was the only method to connect to the blockchain. This requirement has been alleviated by service providers that facilitate blockchain access through their nodes, but it should be noted that while convenient, this brings us to the problem of centralization, as now clients are dependent on a single authority providing a gateway to the network. Furthermore each additional node connected directly to the network improves the blockchain's decentralization, increasing interconnectivity and fault-tolerance.

Nodes are responsible for accepting transactions from clients, validating them, and adding them to blocks which get recorded in the immutable history of the blockchain. Blocks contain references to those before it via cryptographic hash and sequence number. In other words, they are chronologically related. This sequence of blocks is referred to as a blockchain. Some blockchains facilitate advanced functionality such as smart contracts which are applications that are executed in the distributed environment.

## The creation and circulation of digital assets

Cryptocurrencies are subject to the rules of the code through which they are implemented. The distribution of digital assets varies depends on the model which the software employs, for proof of work blockchains, the mining process results in the creation of currency which is granted to the individuals / organizations that first solve the proof-of-work challenge for each block. With proof-of-stake systems, existing holders of the currency are rewarded with additional currency when they validate transactions. Other systems, such as those implementing Byzantine Consensus solutions, preallocate digital assets on genesis and prohibit any new currency creation from occurring thereafter. The code dictates every operation.

This software also governs the nature of the decentralized communication which the network leverages. At the onset, a new node will communicate with a fixed list of peers to retrieve information pertaining to additional nodes in the network. From there communication propagates outwards and peers are connected to in order to discover more. Depending on the blockchain, the algorithms may be built to reward computers that contribute to operation of the network. The cryptocurrency's code establishes parameters such as maximum supply, mining incentives, network fees, and so on.

The programming that defines a cryptocurrency's creation process determines how coins are generated. Instead of mining or mining alone, a cryptocurrency may produce some tokens as developer rewards upon launch, or it might award tokens as an interest to token holders. Many cryptocurrencies can be mined by anybody, but it is a complex and time-consuming operation.

Mining entails groups of computers working together to solve mathematical problems. When the problem is solved, tokens for the cryptocurrency in question, such as bitcoin, are generated, and the computer that found the answer receives the new token. Mining is also responsible for the security of cryptocurrencies is proof of work systems. The blockchain, which keeps track of every single token in a cryptocurrency, is linked to the mathematical problems that are being solved. The most recent mathematical problem not only generates additional tokens but also verifies the most recent transactions.

## There be whales!

![whales](@/assets/posts/decentralization-key-metrics/whales.jpg)

A whale is a phrase used in the cryptocurrency world to describe persons or entities who own huge quantities of a specific coin. Depending on the market whales may have the ability to affect the value of the currency. The movements of whales tend to have a disproportionate impact on the market, either through increased volatility, decreased liquidity, or a combination of the two. Whales get their name from the fact that their motions disrupt the waters in which smaller fish swim. For example, the top 20% of bitcoin holders possess more than 80% of the bitcoin value in US dollars, according to the 80-20 rule (also known as the Pareto principle). Whales may be a concern for cryptocurrencies because the concentration of wealth, especially if it remains undisturbed in an account. If the whale transfers a big amount of that coin at once, volatility rises even more. The whales who are the big holders may try to sell their assets in smaller increments over a longer period in order to avoid bringing attention to themselves, but even in those scenarios market distortions often occur, causing prices to rise or fall unexpectedly. Whales encourage little fish to speculate, which can lead to a vicious cycle in which prices grow disconnected from underlying fundamentals.

In extreme cases, whales have been known to engage in market manipulations, placing huge orders on the books that is significantly higher/lower than all other orders in the market. As a result of the price may drop or skyrocket and panic ensues and the market becomes more volatile. This may stabilize over time, but not until after damage is done, the price being where whales intended it to be, allowing them to buy and sell assets at their preferred prices.

## Who is developing blockchain apps?

![data center](@/assets/posts/decentralization-key-metrics/data-center.jpg)

Decentralization varies depending on the blockchain protocol and adoption. Decentralized applications (dApps) and Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAOs) faciliate **Smart Contracts**, decentralized applications running on the blockchain. The maturity of the solution, the time-proven dependability of its incentive models and consensus processes, and the capacity of the founding team to strike the correct balance determine the adoption level. Many DAOs, for example, have components at various stages of decentralization: oracles (third-party services that provide smart contracts with external information) may be partially decentralized, smart contracts may be fully centralized, and the governance process for adjusting parameters may be community-driven and decentralized.

Decentralized blockchain solutions are being studied and implemented by organizations of all types, sizes, and industries on a larger scale. Applications that give quick international or emergency help to individuals in need without the involvement of a bank, government, or third-party institution are prominent examples. Additionally, smart contracts are being built that let users control their own digital identities and data. Today, social media platforms, businesses, and other groups sell this information for a profit, with no value to the user. It would be easier to make it equal for everyone if it were decentralized.

## An example from the real world

Consider an e-commerce business in the United States that relies on an out-of-date letters of credit system to conduct foreign trade payments. These letters of credit, which are issued on behalf of a customer by an intermediary bank, serve as a guarantee of payment for purchasers. While this approach is reliable, it is also labor-intensive, sluggish, and inefficient.

The e-commerce business recognizes the value and necessity of digitizing and automating their letters of credit procedure However, allowing mutual confidence and verification between vendors and customers is a difficulty they confront. They may turn to a decentralized, blockchain-based innovation to manage international trade payments, which would be more efficient, cost-effective, and less dangerous. This decentralized approach also improves openness by allowing all stakeholders to see the data and documents in real time.

## Decentralization in Cryptocurrency

It's helpful to think about blockchain in terms of how it's been implemented by XRP or XLM to have a better grasp of it.

Ths blockchain, like a database, relies on a network of computers to store and transmit its data.

This database that keeps track of every transaction ever issued for every XRP/XLM.

Unlike traditional databases databases, the nodes that host the blockchain are not all housed under one roof, and each computer or set of computers is run by a single person or group of people.

Consider a firm that has a server with 10,000 machines and a database that contains all of its clients' account information. This firm has a warehouse that houses all of these computers under one roof and has complete control over each of them and the information they hold. Similarly, XRP is made up of thousands of computers, but each computer or group of computers that holds its blockchain is located in a different part of the world and is run by different people. Nodes are the machines that make up the XRP ledger. The blockchain is used in a decentralized manner in this concept. Private, centralized blockchains, on the other hand, exist in which all of the machines that make up the network are owned and managed by a single organization or a small group of them.


![dag](@/assets/posts/decentralization-key-metrics/dag.png)

Each node in the network contains a record of the data saved on the blockchain. XRP, XLM, and other similar blockchains allow nodes to operate with a minimal data set of the most recent transactions, though it may be desirable to store the full history for verification and analysis purposes. If a node's data is incorrect, it may utilize the thousands of other nodes as a point of reference to fix it. This manner, no one node in the network may change the data it contains. As a result, the history of transactions in each block of the blockchain is unchangeable.

If one user tampers with a transaction record, all other nodes will cross-reference each other, making it easy to find the node that has the wrong data. This system aids in the establishment of a precise and clear sequence of occurrences. A blockchain can store a variety of information, such as legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory. For XRP and XLM, this information is a record of ownership of the currency, list of transactions, order on the decentralized exchange, escrows, trust lines, and much more. 

A majority of the decentralized network's operators would have to agree on the modifications in order to modify how that system functions or the information stored inside it. This guarantees that any changes that do take place are in the majority's best interests.

## The Metrics of Decentralization

Choosing a collection of measures to employ in comparing projects, organizations, or national economies may be a difficult task. Even the most steadfast national accounting measures are not without their detractors. After its inception in 1934, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) faced immediate and vociferous opposition. Critics of the unemployment rate say that removing those who aren't actively looking for work from the base population misrepresents the labor market's state.

Nonetheless, both of these indicators are extensively used and noteworthy because they give insight into crucial aspects of the economy's health. Despite unavoidable disagreements, it is critical not to give up on the task of assessing economic systems. Without weekly unemployment data from the Department of Labor, it would be far more difficult to understand the new coronavirus's extraordinary impact on the US labor force.

This holds true for both blockchain and state and national economies. Blockchain-based systems are code-based economies. Economic fundamentals determine the value of a protocol and its native tokens. As a result, users, validators, and investors benefit from a common set of metrics for assessing these fundamentals and determining if systems are operating as intended.

Consider the concept of decentralization. Proof-of-work protocols state that decentralization in mining is a primary objective of their project. When asked to describe this more precisely, they are unable to do so. Some propose evaluating decentralization indirectly through profitability or governance, aiming for a minimal number of participating miners, while others propose gauging decentralization directly through node operation and network topology. The industry talks past itself without an agreed-upon structure.

Decentralization, for example, may be measured rigorously using economics as a paradigm. In the analysis of industries, measures like the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index are commonly employed to represent the distribution of market power among actors. These criteria, when applied to block production, determine how decentralized miner influence and incentives are in practice.

Where S1, S2, etc, refer to the percentage market share that various companies hold in the given industry
</div>

These frameworks were used by the Open Application Network (OAN) to assess the impact of a recent protocol change on mining decentralization. The founding team was worried that a small number of mining pools had an outsized effect on block production because it was originally a Proof-of-Work protocol. They established a Proof of Stake consensus method in November 2019, but had limited ways to measure how successful their decentralization efforts were until recently.

Using economic criteria, the OAN team concluded that including Proof-of-Stake significantly decreased block production centralization, changing them from a highly centralized platform to one that is more in line with industry leaders. Other metrics such as the Nakamoto Coefficient are being used to quantify decentralization in a standardized way.

![nakamoto coefficient](@/assets/posts/decentralization-key-metrics/nakamoto-coefficient.png)

Measurement advantages, and the dosage of truth it may provide, are applicable to more than simply mining decentralization. While blockchain initiatives differ in terms of token design, consensus, and governance, they all have the same goal in mind: to create widely used and valuable tokens, democratize influence and power, and increase access to money and data. It might take months – or perhaps years – for the industry to agree on an uniform quantitative methodology for tracking progress toward these objectives, but the effort will be well worth it.
