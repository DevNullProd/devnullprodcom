A decade ago, if you were told that the world will conduct transactions in a decentralized manner without the involvement of banks or central authorities, you would be right to be skeptical. However, today the world has come to accept digital currencies, aka cryptocurrencies, as the next stage of the financial revolution. Whether you are a long time "HODLr" or have just recently learned about cryptocurrencies due to their increasing popularity, it is crucial to understand the history of digital assets and how the underlying blockchain technology works. While the creator of Bitcoin is unknown and its subsequent history is fraught with volatility and speculation, this base level of knowledge is essential for any investment and trading decision.

## Age of Digital Currency

Trust is an essential part of any monetary system

Digital currency like any other money or currency, is stored or exchanged for other valuable assets. It can be represented via a central database, held by a bank or other financial institution, a distributed database, or an alternative computer-based system. Compared with traditional currencies such as dollars, euros, and yen (referred to as **fiat** currencies), as well as other stores of value such as gold and commodities, digital currencies feature their own unique benefits and drawbacks.

Because cryptocurrencies exist exclusively in the digital world, unlike physical currency, it is often easier to trace the flow of capital. While your bank may keep dollars for you, as soon as you withdraw it, it becomes all the harder to trace its movement. Furthermore the integrity of the system is based on faith and trust that the purchasing power will be preserved while you hold onto the asset. In order to build the next generation of digital assets, these systems had to have been built from scratch in a way that instills that trust for mass consumption... no easy feat! This led to various efforts to build cryptocurrencies before the current inception of blockchain technology.

No initiative before Bitcoin managed to attain broad popularity and adoption, including many proposals from the Netherlands and the United States in the early 1980s. Digicash was one of the first but never really took hold, and ultimately failed in the 90s. Later, PayPal and its competitors developed a hybrid approach, managing digital transactions with existing fiat currencies. These companies still play an important role in international and internet trade. The drawback though is that users were still reliant on centralized systems that often enforced vague and arbitrary rules pertaining to who was allowed to use the technology. This resulted in many individuals getting "locked out" with their capital frozen and unable to be accessed.

## The emergence of Bitcoin

Additional early cryptocurrency efforts include B-Money (invested by Wei Dai), Hashcash, Flooz and Bit Gold. David Chaum, an informatician and mathematician, founded DigiCash and was an influential figure in the early development of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin's original genesis is far more obscure.

Satoshi Nakamoto released the whitepaper describing the Bitcoin protocol in 2009, and the genesis block was mined shortly there after. Blockchain technology, which Bitcoin is an exemplary instance of, comprises of a serial sequence (or 'chain') of so-called **blocks** used to encapsulate transactions, facilitating the exchange of value. Each block has a header, which in return contains a hash, uniquely identifying the block. These blocks are generated in sequence, from the Genesis block onward. This public history is one of the various attributes that instills trust in the blockchain.

Bitcoin's Genesis block was the first instance of a blockchain proof-of-work system (the process through which it is implemented known as **mining**) and served as a template for subsequent systems. In the years since Bitcoin's creation, many more blockchains have been invented, some sharing the proof-of-work methodology and many that offer alternative solutions facilitating the transfer for value.

*Important Information*

- In 2009, a developer named Satoshi Nakamoto created the Bitcoin protocol and mined the first blocks.
- The first block of any blockchain is known as its **Genesis Block**.
- Proof of work serves as the foundational basis for Bitcoin trading system and still serves as the prototype for other Blockchains

To this date, the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. Many efforts have been unsuccessfully made to ascertain his/her identity, and whether he/she is a single individual or a group of individuals, the world may never know. Given the large value of Bitcoin produced by the early blocks mined by Satoshi, this individual or group currently has claim to a large amount of purchasing power.

What is known is the core principles governing Bitcoin have yet to be compromised. No one has successfully attacked the Bitcoin protocol, nor has a double-spend occurred, a situation where Bitcoin owner is able to spend the same cryptocurrency multiple times. This and the pseudo-anonymous nature of the protocol has lead to a degree of confidence in the system. In March 2021, the nominal value of all Bitcoin in existence (the **market cap**), a metric of the fiat market rate facilitated by exchanges, exceeded $1 trillion. That being said, the currency is very volatile and typically changes significantly over short periods.

## Bitcoin's popularity explodes

![magic internet money](@/assets/posts/crypto-from-genesis-to-now/magic-internet-money.png)

There may not be a more accurate portrayal of Bitcoin and early perceptions of it than this crudely drawn Microsoft Paint picture, showing a wizard with the phrase "Magic Internet Money" in blue robe. The picture was designed to encourage visitors to find out more about the money in Reddit and to join the Bitcoin community. In the early days Bitcoin was seen as a fun experiment where individuals possessing moderate processing power (mostly manifested via graphics cards) were able to easily participate in the system and receive payouts of Bitcoin in return. When the ad came to life, the community comprised a little over 50,000 users, and Bitcoin's worth was still less than $300.

For reference, 1.2 million people are now on the same forum. Almost 600 comments were made to discuss the marketing and artwork itself. It is an example of a successful grassroots marketing effort in which a specialized group was able to convey the ideals of a system for mass consumption. Bitcoin users have accepted and never shied away from the geeky categorization that the media and legacy financial industry gave to them. Although the currency's future was constantly damaged and attacked, the network "magically" continued to run.

## Libertarian ideals

If you have entered the unending discourse over Bitcoin lately, you may get the perception that the digital currency is little more than the newest obsession from Wall Street and a juiced-up version of PayPal. After all, in recent weeks so many stories have focused on its market price and the amazing thing you can get:

"Bitcoin breaks $60,000!"

"Bitcoin is down over 50%!"

"Bitcoin has a Black Friday banner!"

"Use Bitcoin to buy a trip on Elon Musk's spaceship!"

Bum all the discussion about the value (or lack) of Bitcoin obscures the reality that it was never actually designed to be an investment, nor was it designed to be a method to get sex toys or alpaca socks - not to mention a brand new Lamborghini. One may argue that Bitcoin is not mainly an enterprise, a weird thing to say about some sort of online cash, but rather an intellectual foray into a new type of asset, programmable money and more philosophically the emergence of digital 'hard money' to replace that of legacy (and often corrupt) financial systems.

This certainly has jived with the libertarian crowd, whom have long taken issue with the so called *shadow banking system* an governed by central banks and international financial institutions. Whether or not this narrative continues to hold in coming years is anyone's guess.

## Speculation and Mining

Bitcoin is minted through the mining process, in which powerful computers (typically known as "mining rigs") are awarded a payout for reverse engineering a difficult cryptographic equation. Outside of this, free market forces come to work as the price fluctuations of Bitcoin are affected by many variables. The institutional or celebrity backing of particular cryptocurrencies frequently spurs fast price growth, while media buzz and backing for broader blockchain initiatives can assist in the raising of price levels.

Regulatory involvement, sophisticated hacking activities and "FUD" (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) have been responsible for diminishing Bitcoin's nominal value, as well as the of other cryptocurrencies. On the other hand scarcity (or at least *perceived* scarcity) is a factor that has helped propel Bitcoin's bull markets. Only 21 million bitcoins will be generated, which at projected mining rates means that the final Bitcoin will be mined in 2140. This is not to say the protocol cannot be changed between now and then to alter this limit, but this is the assumption the market is currently operating on.

Recently Bitcoin has achieved an all-time high of almost $63,500, but in the years since its inception many other cryptocurrencies outside Bitcoin have emerged on the scene, many providing far greater Return of Investments. Altcoins (occasionally dubbed "shitcoins" by Bitcoin maximalists) address a plethora of use cases. Bitcoin has quadrupled its value, while many altcoins explode 30 times, 40 times, or 50 times within days. One of the most renowned is Dogecoin which, due to the powerful combo of Reddit and Elon Musk pumping the narrative, has been soaring in value. While these market movements may change lives, there are pitfalls around each corner. Fortunes may be built in seconds, but also lost equally as fast. Scammers and fraudsters are everywhere, traders at every stage are exposed to malicious behaviour and bad actors.

## Types of Cryptocurrencies

To this day Bitcoin stands as the 800 pound gorilla of the digital assets ecosystem. The market is more than four times the size of the next largest coin, Ethereum, and typically around 30 times the size of other alt-coins which compete for market share.

That being said Bitcoin isn't the only participant in the game, and history has shown no technology standardizes on version one. As its popularity grew, similar blockchain technology was used as the basis of an exploding asset class. The predominant Bitcoin alternative is Ethereum, which is used to implement **Smart Contracts** (distributed programs) and touts the second highest crypto market cap. However, there are many others to pick from. The following listed currencies with the greatest market capitalizations according to coinmarketcap.com (June 2021):

- Ethereum
- Tether
- Binance Coin
- Cardano
- Dogecoin
- XRP
- USD Coin
- Polkadot

Some of these, such as Tether and USD Coin, are known as **stablecoins**, supposedly tied to and back by the US dollar at a 1-1 ratio, though in recent years there has been speculation as to if this is actually true. Other cryptocurrencies implement protocols other than proof-of-work intended to improve transaction speeds and efficiency, including proof-of-stake and Byzantine Consensus.

## Cryptocurrency's Future

Cryptocurrency looks to be on pace for greater broad acceptance. While adjustments and hiccups might occur along the way, blockchain technology has been ever-increasingly popular. In the past year digital assets have garnered the backing and attention of big investment institutions such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan. The sector has come far from being a niche geeky meme on the Internet!
