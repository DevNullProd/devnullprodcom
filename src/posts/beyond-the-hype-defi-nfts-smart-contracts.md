## Introduction

Centralized systems, where governance is maintained through a central authority, are as old as humanity itself. While the centralized structure is a formidable one, human nature poses challenges with these systems and thus often alternatives are desirable.

In centralized systems, if the decision maker is corrupted or unavailable, the entire system suffers. The implication is that every other part will be dependent on the central authority for direction and authorization. This is why in during downtime in traditional financial systems (such as banks) account owners cannot access their funds. In some extreme cases, a part of the structure can easily defraud the system and abscond with stolen capital.

These issues prompted the development of decentralized systems and blockchain technology in recent years. The progenitors of the industry realized that instead of having a single point-of-failure that gateways everything, all the participants in the system could control their own assets and destiny. These systems breed fairness and transparency for all actors and independent agents involves.

Decentralization is typically implemented through peer-to-peer networks where individual entities chose the peers to work with rather than depend on any particular part. Participants of the system are in complete control in a trustless and efficient way. An excellent example of such systems is the Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, XLM, and other cryptocurrency networks.

The ingenuity of the blockchain system gave birth to other structures currently revolutionizing world economies, which we will discuss below.

## Decentralized Finance (DeFI)

Decentralized Finance (DeFI), are applications built on blockchain networks offering a range of financial solutions. The design of DeFI networks aim to create transparent, trustless systems where users control their finances without depending on any central authority.

DeFI facilitates use cases that operate in a decentralized manner while providing services traditionally satisfied by centralized financial solutions. Examples of this include systems to create and issue digital assets (as well as those representing real world assets such as fiat currencies, gold, and more), Decentralized Exchanges, allowing users to buy and sell assets without intervention, lending and capital services paying out interest, and much more.

DeFi can be implemented via native functionality on the blockchain (XRP, XLM), via smart contracts (ETH, TRON), or a hybrid approach. Blockchain networks facilatate opening new doors for financial markets that will be built solely on decentralized networks. DeFI applications aim to be interoperable, connecting seamlessly with other technologies to provide a dynamic / seemless solutions for its users.

### Pros of DeFI

DeFI brings financial services to the underbanked, those who do not have access to traditional financial services, and much more. DeFI does not require any intermediaries to work, and thus more users will be able to access financial services than ever before.

Another significant advantage of DeFI is offering affordable financial service to anyone, including business enterprises. DeFI solutions increase liquidity and capital available to entrepreneurs and others in need of it due to the competitive nature of free market economies. With DeFI, business owners can develop their own cash points and revenue streams independent of central institutions. Furthermore the tokenization of traditional financial assets allow consumers and businesses alike to issue and mint their own currencies through which others can access their products and value. This is an exciting opportunity for progressive enterprises.

### Limitations

Despite its effective structure, DeFI is not without its limitations. As with other blockchain solutions, the peer-to-peer nature of the networks prose scalability and throughput challenges. The blockchain is structured so that it depends on a decentralized consensus mechanism to verify transactions. This is effective but is a slow process that often takes longer times to complete. The technology is still in its infancy and developers are still working on building faster and more efficient processes for transaction verification to optimize operations.

## Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT)

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are unique and tradable digital artificats representing value. Unlike fungible assets (fiat currency, BTC, gold), each asset is unique and **not** interchangeable with other assets. They are often used as the basis of digital collectible assets that you can never replace with another acquisition, even one of equal value. For instance, one BTC is the same as any other, but a NFT representing a piece of digital art of a real world asset such as a deed or lease does not have the same properties or market value as another. NFTs have unique digital footprints that make them valuable on their own.

Trading NFTs in a marketplace will give you a completely different asset that has value. For instance, you can trade a digital painting for a game artifact that you can use in your game console. In that way, you can use your valued item and get another asset that you need or want!

NFTs are often implemented as smart contracts but more and more blockchains are offering NFTs as part of their core service. Lately, the focus for NFTs has been more on digital art, but solutions are being built to use NFTs to represent real world assets such as a deed to a house or a financial contract.

The gaming industry is the latest entrant into the NFT scene with great potential around providing game collectibles and artifacts via a NFT marketplace. Imagine getting exclusive rights to an in-game inventory item that you need for your in-game mission on the digital market. Once you're done using it, you can trade it for another, thus securing another asset of value. NFTs are bringing unique tangible value to blockchain and has been rapidly increasing in adoption and popularity.

## Smart Contracts

The Bitcoin protocol contains a rudimentary system facilitating programatic execution of logic governing when a recipient of Bitcoin can access the funds sent to them. The Ethereum protocol was conceptualized in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin to expand upon this, facilitating a general purpose application execution environment directly on the Blockchain. Smart Contracts were born with Ethereum, but have since evolved to address a plethora of use cases with many Blockchains implementing smart contract functionality.

When transactions referencing smart contracts are processed by the network, the embedded logic are executed and the results stored on chain. Smart contacts typically consume network fees such that the more operations are executed, the more the owner pays. This is to ensure applications are efficiently written and malicious users cannot compromise the network to impact service and cause damage.

On Ethereum, smart contracts are implemented in the **Solidity** language, while other blockchains implement their own standards (often compatible with Ethereum).

### How Does Smart Contracts Works

Let's say, for instance, that John wants to buy a car worth $200,000, and he enters into an agreement with his friend Jim, a car dealer who conducts business using the blockchain. John will escrow $200,000 worth of an agreed upon digital asset via a smart contract that will, in conjunction with a real-world oracle providing financial insight, deliver the cash to Jim once the inspection of the new car is confirmed. Jim and John do not need to meet for this transaction to go through. Everything is executed automatically and without any third party, not even a lawyer.

Smart contracts save their users a lot of money and stress that they would have wasted on third-party interventions. It's an innovative way for real-world transactions that can work in any economy. Smart contracts have found usability in financial services, legal processes, insurance services, and even global finance.

### Limitations

Despite being a novel technology, Smart contracts have continued to improve in recent years through innovative works of developers. Like DeFI and other blockchain solutions, Smart Contracts are limited via the bandwidth and fees imposed by the networks they are running on and thus the applications are limited to those that can tolerate that latency. It is believed that despite limitations, upgrades on Smart contracts will continue to improve application and performance in coming years. Rome wasn't built in a day, and the future is bright for systems that can potentially run solely on Smart contracts.
