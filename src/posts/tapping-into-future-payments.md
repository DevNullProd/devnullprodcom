As society becomes ever-increasingly digitalized, the demand for effective and universal payment systems continues to grow unabated. It's been thirteen years since Satoshi Nakomoto released the Bitcoin whitepaper, launching a revolutionary new industry in the process.

Blockchain and the many technologies built on it facilitate transparent, censorless financial systems, enabling digital payments without the need of centralized institutions. As of today, the market cap of Bitcoin alone exceeds One-Trillion-Dollars, ranking it as the quickest asset to attain this milestone.

## Traditional Payment Systems vs. Cryptocurrencies

Traditional payment systems are built on siloed networks linked together through centralized bureaucracies. In the United States, more than 25 billion transactions are processed each year by the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network, an electronic network of banks and financial institutions. The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, aka SWIFT, provides a network that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions. EFTs, many wire systems, and more each provide a singular view of the financial landscape.

Consumer oriented systems are no different, and in some senses it is more difficult to bridge gaps. Paypal and Venmo are both owned by the same company but users cannot transfer funds between them. The former is notorious for arbitrary suspending user accounts with little to no notice or reason, locking consumers and business alike out of their funds with no opportunity for recourse. The financial industry is fraught with nightmare scenarios in which legitimate, tax-paying individuals and institutions cannot access their capital for months and years at a time.

At its foundation, the Blockchain comprises a public ledger that automatically tracks all economic activity. All transactions, accounts, and related data are duplicated on every node on the network, they all form part of this optimally organized structure. Nodes on the network are responsible for validating transactions. Invalid ones, such as those attempting to spend the same currency twice (called a *double spend*) are automatically blocked. Trust is caked into the system at the core level. This technology also mitigates the necessity for humans to act as gatekeepers. All transactions are public and can be easily monitored, which is also a plus for accountability.

Crypto adoption has exploded in recent years and as a result conventional financial systems have changed drastically. Now sending money is as easy and fast as as sending an email. Crypto amplifies this be providing financial opportunities to the unbanked, frictionless liquidity on demand, and much more. By accepting crypto, businesses expand their financial footprint beyond local markets limited to legacy systems marked with high fees and bureaucratic structures.

## Blockchain as a Viable Option

Blockchain grants everyone the permission to carry out economic activity based on a new foundation, regardless of race, gender, age, nationality and more. On the other hand, conventional institutions operating on an obsolete infrastructure, struggle to keep up with the pace of rapid innovation and constantly have to strive towards improvement. As society becomes more digitalized, paper money and coins become increasingly irrelevant, and in the near future, currency will be a large part digital. In years to come, will we no longer have banks? And what would eventually be the bank's role if cryptocurrency is responsible for a larger proportion of cash flow?

Realistically speaking this is an unlikely scenario. Rather more likely, legacy institutions will adopt emerging technologies to serve their and their customer's purposes. Banks, market markers, and payment providers benefit from increased frictionless liquidity. This means better profit margins and more financial opportunities. Consumers benefit from more choices and rapid innovation. Inorder to realize this, legacy systems need to be retrofitted to work with newer technologies, and newer technologies need adapters and integrations with legacy systems.

### An Opportunity, Rather than a Threat

Should we be scared of these recent trends in virtual currency? While what the future has in store is still uncertain, society is already experiencing the effects of this brand new trend, which according to experts can be likened to the emergence of the Internet in the mid-1990s, and with it a plethora of new apps and use cases are in development.

So, the savvy investor and entrepreneur sees this not as a threat but rather an opportunity. In recent times, the sector has undergone an influx of those trying out this new technology. This new and old worlds always eventually converge, afterall advancing into the future while honoring the traditions of old is one of the core tenets of civilization.

More effective payment methods, facilitated by Blockchain, are now in vogue; our old ways of transacting, now replaced by technologies which are more secure, decentralized, and less error-prone. Businesses now experience significant growth in their sales without paying expensive chargebacks or having to undergo frustrating obstacles due to differences in currencies and financial systems.

## Final Notes
In this fast-paced and constantly changing world, disruption of traditional banking is gradually unveiling. Every day, the future is being born. We are witnessing fintech causing the rise of more innovations, which increases adoption, which leads to more innovation, and so on and so forth... an endless positive feedback loop! Being positioned to anticipate and capitalize on these changes places one in the elite group quite literally building the future.
