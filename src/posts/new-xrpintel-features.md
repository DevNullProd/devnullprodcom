Come one, come all... be sure to checkout the newly deployed features to [xrpintel](https://xrpintel.com)!

- New **Deleted Accounts** metric - tallies the number of accounts deleted in the reporting period

- Expanded **Transactions By Result** metric to highlight / always tweet **Critical Transactions**. Right now this just includes **tecINVARIANT_FAILED** (the final XRPL failsafe ensuring ledger state stays sane & valid), though others may be added in the future

- New ledger and transaction controls: Switch between **formatted** and **raw** JSON, expand and collapse all fields.
