We're please to announce the **Dev Null Blog** a one-stop shop for everything Dev Null.

With this blog we aim to provide latest news and updates about all things Dev Null, from products and features we release, solutions delivered, bugfixes, and more.

The intent is to provide content of interest to a wide-variety of readers, from users who are interested in the content we provide, to developers looking to build upon our services + many more.

Be sure to stay tuned as we're just getting started and lots of great content is coming soon!
