Q2 saw a continuation of the XRPL trends from [Q1](/post/xrp-2020-quarter-1.html) with ledgers closed, transactions sent, and offers created consistent with those from the last quarter (daily averages differing by **-1%**, **-6.9%**, and **4.5%** respectively). The average number of payments saw a more significant change, declining from **115,975.70** per day to **65,783.23** (**-43.27%**), though an above-average payment volume early on in the January timeframe skewed the averages from that quarter. This was likely a continuation of the excessive [transaction activity](https://twitter.com/DevNullProd/status/1200463431431839744) that we noted from last fall/winter, as once this tapered off, payment volume adhered to a consistent / bound range. The number of accounts created saw a nice uptick in Q2, increasing from an average of **695.41** per day to **905.97** (**30%**).

As with other reports we start with the most stable metric, ledgers closed. In the months of April, May, and June, **2,024,347** total ledgers were closed with a weekly average of **155,511.25** ledgers and a daily average of **22,492.74**.

The network saw **84,666,157** total transactions last quarter with a daily average of **940,735.08** transactions and a weekly average of **6,549,072.25**. The standard deviation from the daily average was **74,690.86** transactions, or **7.94%**. Overall this was one of the most consistent metrics that we collect with transactions being issued to the network at a constant rate with low variance for the entire quarter, as seen in the charts below:

**102,148.65** XRP was burnt in fees during the quarter, with a daily average of **1,134.99** XRP and a weekly average of **8,227.53**.
