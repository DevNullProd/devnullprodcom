With recent events around the COVID-19 pandemic still ongoing, the beginning of this quarter seems like eons ago yet the XRP ledger has been in continuous operation during this entire period. While the network has seen a drop in activity from the [plethora of transactions](https://twitter.com/DevNullProd/status/1200463431431839744) which tested the network last fall, the XRPL is still undergoing sustained usage with variable periods of activity on different fronts. One notable benchmark is the [recent increate in account activity](https://twitter.com/DevNullProd/status/1242193606066057216) which is still higher than typical averages. The exact cause for this is still unknown but could indicate increased interest in XRP technologies

As with our [yearly report](/post/2019-in-xrp.html), we start with the baseline metric of **Ledgers Closed** which as expected is fairly consistent with low variance. In the last 3 months, **2,051,380** total ledgers were closed with a weekly average of **157,850.25** ledgers and an daily average of **22,793.11** ledgers.

The next metric computed is total transactions, which amounted to **90,949,838** last quarter, with an average rate of **1,010,553** transactions per day. 2020-01-06 was the week seeing the highest number of transactions: **11,599,975** (avg: **74.71** per ledger) with 2020-03-02 seeing the fewest, **6,979,812** total trasnactions (**38.04** per ledger). The standard deviation from the daily average was **330,982.60** transactions, representing a **32.75%** variance.

As far as fees burnt (recall every transaction on the XRPL consumes a small amount of XRP in fees), the network deducted **99,169.32** XRP overall (**99,169,322,795** drops) with a weekly average of **8,264.11** XRP and an daily average of **1,134.93** XRP. The day of 2020-03-15 saw an [anomalous transaction](https://xrp1ntel.com/tx/AA7FC77B19391C7D6FDEF49ACA4594E7F36CE6B7E943793ECC6B160396AE1714) that needlessly burned a large amount of XRP (**26,057.85!**) in fees resulting in a large spike on total fees burnt on that day / week (always test your software **before** production!)
