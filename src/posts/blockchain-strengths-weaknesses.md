When it comes to payments and finance, security, privacy, and interoperability are important considerations. In the past, one had to make tradeoffs when adopting solutions, as there have been no efficient and reliable way to digitally store and transfer value while simultaneously maintaining independence from centralized institutions such as banks and payment providers.

That is until the emergence of the revolutionary technology dubbed the Blockchain!

## What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is, in essence, a serial sequence (aka a 'chain') of blocks, each containing a reference to the previous block as well as a record of transactions. Blocks are replicated and transmitted across networks of computer systems and the Internet. Blocks on the blockchain are secured via cryptography with transactions facilitating the transfer of value throughout the network and the world.

Blockchains are typically implemented as decentralized ledgers with nodes running specialized software constituting the peer-to-peer networks governing operations. Today blockchains are being used for many purposes, predominantly for storing and transmitting value, and just like every other technology, there are tradeoffs to using the blockchain.

## Advantages of Blockchain

Here are some of the many benefits of Blockchain technology.

### Data Accuracy

The network of nodes authorizes the transactions that are executed to transfer ownership of digital assets from one account to another. Nodes are responsible for independently verifying the accuracy and integrity of these transactions and cryptography is used to ensure only those who are authorized to conduct operations are allowed to do so. This makes for a more accurate record of information since there is no human involvement in verification and the network has to come to a consensus of the state of operation before proceeding.

Even in a rare situation whereby a mistake arises from one of the computers in the network, the error would be local to that node without affecting the others on the network. The other nodes would simply discard any invalid activity, thus preserving the integrity of the system.

### Robustness

Peer to peer networks are robust by nature as even if a subset of nodes operating the network go down, the network can continue operating and validating transactions. Nodes are designed to be fault tolerant by nature, taking into account many scenarios in which bad actors and/or unreliable operational environments can impact operations. Should any situation occur where the integrity of the ledger would become questionable, the network typically errs on the side of caution, discarding malicious and invalid activity.

Thus the result is a highly-reliable mechanism which to store and transmit value.

### Pseudo-privacy

While not truly anonymous, blockchain networks are pseudo-confidential, as the identify of individual digital asset holders are not known to outsiders. While most exchanges and on/off ramps implement Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti Money Laundering (AML) procedures to verify the identity of customers, the core operation of the network does not involve the storing or transmitting of any of this information.

### Decentralization

Because Blockchain work via a decentralized platforms, all data does not need to be stored in a central location. Rather, the information is split up (a process called *sharding*), duplicated, and transmitted across a network of computers. Whenever a new block is appended to the Blockchain, every computer that operates on the network reflects the change by updating its local database.

Furthermore a sufficiently distributed and decentralized network enhances security since its infeasible to hack all Blockchain nodes simultaneously and only the particular nodes that have been hacked will be affected.

### Transparency

All blockchains are implemented via open source software and thus the code is complete visible and auditable. Security through obscurity is not an issue with the blockchain! The transparency of this technology is further appreciated in that any individual or organization can make suggestions for an upgrade for the Blockchain. If the majority of the nodes governing the blockchain consent to changes, they are ratified into network operations.

### Efficiency

Being in different time zones and legal jurisdictions makes transactions done using a traditional financial solutions take much more time since all parties involved in such a deal need to confirm validity and legality. Blockchain, on the other hand, can be done in a much more efficient manner since the operation rules of the network are guaranteed before hand and the network can quickly process requests.

### Immutability

Another advantage of blockchain technology is the permanence data once its has been validated by the network. Since each block references the cryptographic hash (signature) of those before it, one can be assured that once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain and value is transferred, it is permanent and cannot be undone.

### Security

Data and transaction on the blockchain are individually encrypted. During validation, nodes on the blockchain individually validate the integrity of traffic to verify and confirm authenticity. Only after that is done, it is then added to the blockchain.

If at any point a malicious actor attempts to tamper with a block and change it's contents, nodes would immediate know of this behaviour since the block's cryptographic hash would not match that previously transmitted and stored. Bad actors can be identified in such a way and excluded for future participation in the network.

### Banking Alternative

People living in developing countries often find it difficult to store their wealth safely. In lieu of a reliable banking system it is not unheard of to store wealth in holes, pillows, cupboards, wardrobes, under their mattress, and other locations where is easy to steal.

On the other hand, Blockchain information, can be stored on mobile phones, pieces of paper, or even be memorized, which makes it far more efficient and harder to compromise.

Additionally, in such countries and those with unstable governments, Blockchain technology offers the best solution to securing citizens' personal information and finances.

### Disadvantages of Blockchain

Despite the seemingly overwhelming advantages that Blockchain possesses, there are some disadvantages connected to it that we need to consider.

### Storage

Blockchain ledgers have grown over time and are still growing rapidly to the extent that now hundreds of gigabytes to terabytes worth of storage are required. The operational costs are imposing to store and replicate this much data for many.

### Excessive Energy Consumption

For proof-of-work blockchains (those that involve mining), an excessive amount of electricity is used. This energy can arguably be used for other purposes that better serve individuals and organizations.

### Scalability

One of the disadvantages of blockchain is scalability. An overhead is incurred due to the fact that transactions and data need to be replicated through a significant number of nodes on a network to facilitate operations. Because of this, during periods of network congestion, operational fees tend to skyrocket and users are forced to pay more to leverage the blockchain.

### Government Regulations

![government](@/assets/posts/blockchain-strengths-weaknesses/government.jpg)

Because of the independent financial nature of the blockchain, the regulators and authorities in various jurisdictions has made cryptocurrencies illegal and/or hard to use. Such acts are of serious concern because they deprived citizens of their country of the freedom of making transactions using blockchain technology lest they be fined and/or arrested.

Furthermore due to the novelty of this technology, in many jurisdictions the law is ambiguous as to the legality of using decentralized ledgers, leading to operational risk for businesses and other organizations that wish to employ it. That being said many consider the 'genie being out of the bottle' when it comes to the inevitability of blockchain technology adoption.

### Conclusion

As with any emerging technology, blockchain poses many unique benefits and disadvantages to adoption. It is up to each individual to weigh the pros and cons and make the decisions that are right for them.
