Flare is an exciting way to scale smart contracts independently of token valuation. By setting up your XRP account, you can receive Flare Spark tokens for free on the date of the upcoming airdrop. Depending on the wallet you use to manage your XRP, this can take multiple routes. See this [article](https://blog.flare.xyz/spark-claim-guide/) for more information and this [guide](https://flare.wietse.com/) for Xumm and Ledger Nano/xrptoolkit instructions.

Don't use any of these solutions? Don't fret! Dev Null Productions has a tool that can be used by everyone, even those with XRP in cold storage. [FleXRP](https://github.com/DevNullProd/flexrp) is a multi-platform tool which securely and efficiently sets up your XRP account with a few simple steps. Just download the app, fill in the required information, and click the submit button and you are good to go... you will receive Flare Spark tokens when they are released!

To start, download the app corresponding to the system you are running on. <i>You will need to enter your secret key so make sure this is a <b>secure system</b></i>:

- [Windows - flexrp.exe](https://github.com/DevNullProd/flexrp/raw/main/dist/flexrp-1.0.1.exe)
- [MacOS - flexrp.dmg](https://github.com/DevNullProd/flexrp/raw/mani/dist/flexrp-1.0.1.dmg)
- [RedHat Linux - flexrp.rpm](https://github.com/DevNullProd/flexrp/raw/main/dist/flexrp-1.0.1.x86_64.rpm)
- [Debian/Ubuntu Linux - flexrp.deb](https://github.com/DevNullProd/flexrp/raw/main/dist/flexrp_1.0.1_amd64.deb)

Run the app and confirm you are running on a secure system:

Optionally click the settings icon in the upper right to configure application settings.

FleXRP can be used in **offline mode** for further security. If enabled, you will need to configure a few more settings. Read up on those [here](https://xrpl.org/rippleapi-reference.html#transaction-instructions).

Enter your **ETH public address** here:

Click the + icon to create a new ETH wallet, the existing one (if any) will be replaced.

Finally click Submit to setup your account.

If operation in online mode (the default), the transaction will automatically submitted and confirmation presented.

If operating in offline mode, you will be provided the XRP transaction to setup your account.

**YOU MUST SUBSEQUENTLY SUBMIT THIS TRANSACTION FOR IT TO TAKE EFFECT.** The scope of this is outside of this guide.
